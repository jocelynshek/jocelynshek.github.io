								<h2>More than just play</h2>
                                <p> For as long as I can recall, theatre has served as my creative refuge, intellectual challenge, and activist home. From Broadway grosses to Brechtian theory to QLab updates, I'm always eager to learn about and discuss new facets of the art form.
                                    After years working in theater both on and off stage, my favorite memories are ones where audiences have told me that their mindset was challenged, where they felt seen for the first time, where they felt a little less alone—even if just for a few hours. These experiences have inspired me to want to understand the human experience through the lens of cultural expression, particularly how social inequality both shapes and is shaped by arts and media.
                                    I love studying society through both artistic and academic contexts, and am inspired by my background as a multidisciplinary theatre artist to tell well-designed, accessible stories.
                                </p>
								<p>Notably, I acted in the Equity national tour of Heidi Schreck's <i>What the Constitution Means to Me</i> from January 2020 through April 2022, performing in over 180 shows in 12 cities.
